Malware Lookup Service: generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load. Memcached is an in-memory key-value store for small chunks of arbitrary data (strings, objects) from results of database calls, API calls, or page rendering.

High Level Overview: The Malware Lookup Service is comprised of these main components :
  1. Malware Lookup Controller.
  2. Configuration module.
  3. Malware Lookup URL parser and validator
  4. Malware Lookup DOA.
  5. Malware Lookup service.

1. Malware Lookup Controller : The controller is responsible for all the configurations of the memcache server. It is also responsible for maintaining dynamic thread pool to throttle cache performance based on the external demand.

2. Configuration module:  The controller is responsible for all the configurations of the memcache server. It is also responsible for maintaining dynamic thread pool to throttle cache performance based on the external demand.

3. Malware Lookup URL parser and validator:This module is responsible for parsing the incoming request from the client. It is responsible for verifying if the incoming request adheres to memcached text protocol. It also checks the parameters of the request for their validity. It responds to clients following standards of memcached text protocol.

4. Malware Lookup DOA : Once the request is parsed by the protocol parser and verified. The dispatcher forwards the request to the concerned service provider(SET or GET). once the service is completed, results are sent back to clients using standard memcached text protocol.

5. Malware Lookup service : Once the request is parsed by the protocol parser and verified. The dispatcher forwards the request to the concerned service provider(SET or GET). once the service is completed, results are sent back to clients using standard memcached text protocol.


Getting Started: Download IntelliJ IDEA or eclipse based on the underlying OS, make sure you have open JDK-14 installed. Install mysql if you don't have one. Install JUnit and configure it's class path.

Prerequisites: 
1. This project is built with IntelliJ Idea IDE with openJDK14.
2. Also have Junit installed in your class path to run the test cases. 
3. mysql 
4. postman 
5. Git installed.

Installing and running

To deploy using command line and git.
1. Make a directory : “mkdir malwareservice”
2. type “cd malwareservice”
3. git clone https://github.com/cnbscience/MalwareLookupService
4. cd /path/to/malwareservice/malwareService/src/main/java/com/chiddu/malwareservice/malwareService
5. javac -d /path/to/malwareservice/malwareService/target/classes/com/chiddu/malwareservice/malwareService *.java (Not     compulsory if the class files are present)
6. java -classpath  /path/to/malwareservice/malwareService/target/classes/com/chiddu/malwareservice/malwareService malwareService.MalwareServiceApplication
  
If the server is up you will see 

Creating database...
  Database MALWARESERVICEDB created successfully...
  Connecting to database...
  Creating table MALWAREURL_TBL...
  Table created successfully...


To deploy Using IDE like IntelliJ:

  1. Download the project from https://github.com/cnbscience/MalwareLookupService

  2. Import the project into IntelliJ IDEA and run build and run MalwareServiceApplication.

  3. open postman and start sending get queries like one shown below
  
  eg.
   
   Request.
      localhost:8080/v1/urlinfo?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com
  
   Respons.
    you should recieve a response :
    {
      "id": 1,
      "url": "www.google.com",
      "status": "BAD"
    }


Until finished:
The server will keep responding until the client closes it's session. To close the server, just stop the server.

Running unit tests: In the test folder there are two types of tests
